    "## What is a manifold?\n",
    "\n",
    "Manifolds are multi-dimensional surfaces that could look flat if you're up really really close but from far away are curved. The classic example of a manifold is a torus, or \"donut\", where you could reshape a coffee mug into a donut by melting it while preserving the essential aspect - the handle or \"hole.\"\n",

    "The idea behind  manifold embedding algorithms is to maintain the high dimensional structure of the manifold, but plot the data in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math behind these algorithms is actually quite simple. We want to convert each point in high dimensions to a point in two dimensions:\n",

    "* High dimensional data of samples $\\vec{x}_i$ in $N$-dimensional gene space: $\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots \\vec{x}_N$\n",
    "* Low dimensional data $\\vec{y}_i = \\vec{y}_{i, 1}, \\vec{y}_{i, 2}$ (2-dimensional cartesian plane) - $\\vec{y}_1, \\vec{y}_2, \\ldots \\vec{y}_N$\n",

    "t-SNE is an extension of MDS. In addition to maintaining pairwise distances, t-SNE adds the constraint that things that were far apart in the high-dimensional data should also be far apart in 2d, and that things that are close together in high dimensions should stay close together.\n",

    "### Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do *NOT* use t-SNE for clustering!! We will explore how t-SNE can arbitrarily push some cells farther away and create what *look* like clusters but really aren't.\n",
    "* t-SNE is merely a visualization technique - it's a way that you can view ONE perspective of your data, but is NOT the final view\n",
